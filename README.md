# Digital-IC-Tester

Built a digital IC tester to check the functionality of basic 74-series logic gate ICs. The circuit was implemented on a breadboard using standard logic ICs, and also simulated in Verilog using ModelSim.
The tester reads the IC number input via user-operated switches. A built-in counter generates the required input sequences, which are then applied to the IC under test. The output is monitored and automatically compared against expected logic outputs to determine the functionality of the IC.
